Basically it sends any webpage to your Nextcloud Deck by creating a card. 
Here's the option page:

Here's the popup with boards fetched from Nextcloud server (you can select which board and stack is default for sending pages)

The popup loads boards from server, also loads all the stacks and saves them. It uses boards color as background color.

Currently in development:
- Adding to Web Archive in order not to have problems with vanishing websites
- better styling (including UI/UX and console log messages)
- Context menu (currently it's just an icon) -  allow user to send page to different boards and stacks directly from context menu
- Taking screenshots of website and including it as a attachment in card

Ideas for further development:
- rules for specific domains (query selectors), that user can save in options and use them to fill card data sent to server (ie. instead of sending url and title user may input rulese to create card with 'h1' as title and 'p' as a description)
- domain based rules / global rules
- GUI query selector tool (easy for non-technical user)
